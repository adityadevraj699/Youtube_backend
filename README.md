# ![YouTube Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/YouTube_icon_%282013-2017%29.png) YouTube Backend Project

This project is a backend system for a YouTube-like platform, built using **Node.js**, **Mongoose**, and essential tools for a media application. The backend supports comprehensive user authentication, video management, and social interactions, providing a robust framework for scalable development.

## Features

1. **Authentication**: Secure login and registration with hashed passwords using ![bcrypt Logo](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/key.png) bcrypt.
2. **Video Management**: Upload videos and images via ![Cloudinary Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary/image/upload/v1562320626/logo/cloudinary_dark.svg), view all uploaded videos, and delete options.
3. **Subscription System**: Track subscribers and subscriptions with ease, allowing users to manage their subscriber lists.
4. **Watch History**: A feature to track user watch history for revisiting content.
5. **Social Interactions**:
   - **Tweet, Like, and Comment**: Engage with tweets, likes, and comments.
   - **Video Interactions**: Like and comment on videos, with analytics on total liked videos and received comments/likes.
